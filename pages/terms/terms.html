        <section class="terms-container">
            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
            <p>Please read these Standard Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully. By using the Service (defined below) you’re
                agreeing to
                these Terms, which will result in a legal agreement between you and Snip LLC (collectively, "Snip", “we,” or
                “us”).
            </p><br>
    
            <p>We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand these Terms. Snip
                has
                employees, officers, directors, independent contractors, and representatives (“our Team”). As a customer of
                the
                Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to
                this
                Agreement (or “you”). A “Contact” is any person that you, a Member, may contact through our Service. In
                other words,
                a Contact is anyone on a Member's distribution list about whom a Member has given us information or is
                anyone who
                has otherwise interacted with a Member via the Service. For example, if you are a Member, a subscriber to
                your email
                marketing campaigns or a shopper to your Website or Landing Page would be considered a Contact.</p><br>
    
            <p>These Terms define the terms and conditions under which you’re allowed to use the Service in accordance with
                the
                Agreement, which in addition to our <a>Global Privacy Statement</a> and <a>Cookie Statement</a>, describe
                how we’ll
                treat your account and the data we collect and process about you, your end users, and your contacts and
                customers
                while you’re a Member. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of the
                Service.
            </p><br>
    
            <p>Snip uses Google Maps to provide certain features of the Service, and, as a result, we are contractually
                obligated to
                make our Members aware of certain terms related to the use of such features. Therefore, you acknowledge and
                agree
                that by using the Service, you are also bound by the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of
                Service(including
                the Google Privacy Policy).</p><br>
    
            <p>If you have any questions about our Terms, feel free to contact us at legal@snip.com.</p><br>

                    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please read our <a href="#global">Global Privacy Statement below</a>
                        for information regarding how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information and the
                        privacy rights available to you when you use and interact with the Service.
                        For the purposes of privacy and data protection laws, for much of the personal information we
                        process when providing the Service, we act as your processor or service provider in accordance with
                        our Data Processing Addendum. However, there are certain instances, as more fully described in our
                        Global Privacy Statement, where we process personal information, including Content and other data
                        from Member accounts, as a controller to provide and develop the Service and for other important
                        business purposes (e.g., for billing, administrative, security, and product improvement purposes).
                        As described in our Global Privacy Statement ,to provide, develop, and improve other products and
                        services that you connect through the Service or otherwise use in accordance with the applicable
                        Snip terms of service, including to personalize your user experience within the Snip Platform.
                        When we, as a controller, process data that originates from the European Economic Area, UK, or
                        Switzerland in a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under
                        applicable data protection laws, we shall process such data in compliance with the standard
                        contractual clauses between controllers annexed to the European Commission's Implementing Decision
                        2021/914 of 4 June 2021, or the equivalent clauses adopted by the UK Government, and currently
                        located here (the “Controller-to-Controller Clauses”). The terms of the Controller-to-Controller
                        Clauses are incorporated herein by reference and form an integral part of the Agreement between you
                        and Snip.

                    <p> If you are a Kenyan customer:
    
                        You and Snip agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
                        or relating in
                        any way to the Service or this Agreement (a “Claim”) will be determined by binding arbitration or
                        small claims
                        court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
    
                        Either you or Snip can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements
                        of the small
                        claims court are satisfied. Either you or Snip may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims
                        court in your
                        county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your residence, and you may
                        also bring a claim
                        in small claims court.
    
                        Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
                        of a judge or
                        jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
                        courts.
                        Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the Kenyan
                        Arbitration Act
                        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Snip are
                        each waiving the
                        right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
                        survive termination
                        of the Agreement and/or the termination of your Service.
    
                        If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Snip a written Notice of your Claim
                        (“Notice of Claim”).
                        The Notice of Claim to Snip should be sent in care of our registered agent Corporation Service
                        Company, 251 Nairobi,
                        19808. The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like
                        Snip to use to
                        contact you. If Snip elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice
                        of Claim to your
                        address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Snip must (a) describe the nature and
                        basis of the
                        claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought.
    
                        You and Snip agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a
                        prompt, low-cost and
                        mutually beneficial outcome. You and Snip therefore agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but
                        before either
                        you or Snip commence arbitration or file a claim in small claims court against the other, we will
                        personally meet,
                        via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to
                        resolve informally any
                        Claim covered by the Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in
                        the conference as
                        well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. Likewise, if Snip is represented by
                        counsel, its counsel
                        may participate in the conference as well, but Snip agrees to have a company representative fully
                        participate in the
                        conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
                        parties engage in the
                        informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.
    
                        If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after the Notice of
                        Claim is received,
                        you or Snip may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or,
                        alternatively, by filing a
                        Claim in small claims court. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or file a claim in
                        small claims
                        court unless you and Snip are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your
                        completed Notice of
                        Claim and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with Snip during that
                        time. If a Claim
                        qualifies for small claims court, but a party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and Snip
                        agree that either
                        party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of
                        a party’s
                        election, the Kenyan Arbitration Association (“KAA”) will administratively close the arbitration
                        proceeding. Any
                        dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not
                        by an
                        arbitrator. In the event of any such dispute, the arbitration proceeding shall remain closed unless
                        and until a
                        decision by the small claims court that the Claim should proceed in arbitration. You may download or
                        copy a form of
                        notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org or by calling +254-800-700-700. The
                        arbitration will be
                        conducted by the KAA before a single KAA arbitrator under the KAA’s rules, which are available at
                        www.adr.org,
                        except as modified by these Term. Unless Snip and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
                        take place in
                        the county of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.
    
                        The arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to
                        practice law in the
                        Kenya or the county of your residence and will be selected by the parties from the KAA’s National
                        Roster of
                        arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the KAA will send
                        the parties a list
                        of five candidates meeting this criteria; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the
                        list, each party
                        shall return its list to the KAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the
                        remaining candidates
                        in order of preference; (c) the KAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest
                        aggregate ranking;
                        and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the KAA may
                        exercise its
                        discretion in appointing the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. Except as otherwise
                        provided below,
                        all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and
                        enforceability of this
                        arbitration provision.
    
                        You and Snip agree that an administrative conference with the KAA shall be conducted in each
                        arbitration proceeding,
                        and you and a Snip company representative shall appear at the administrative conference via
                        telephone. If you fail
                        to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether your counsel attends, the KAA will
                        administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as
                        to why you were
                        not able to attend the conference.
    
                        The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings
                        and conclusions
                        on which the award is based. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no
                        preclusive effect
                        in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. Snip will not seek to
                        recover its
                        attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration from you unless the arbitrator finds that either the
                        substance of your
                        claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an
                        improper purpose (as
                        measured by the standards set forth in Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on any award may be
                        entered in any
                        court having jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude any party to the
                        arbitration from at any
                        time seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief in aid of arbitration from a court of
                        appropriate
                        jurisdiction including whether a Demand for Arbitration is filed in violation of these Terms.
    
                        Unless you or Snip seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court, the arbitrator shall
                        determine all issues of
                        liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or Snip and may award declaratory or injunctive
                        relief only in
                        favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                        warranted by that
                        party's individual claim. To the extent that you or Snip prevail on a Claim and seek public
                        injunctive relief (that
                        is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
                        threaten future
                        injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil
                        court of competent
                        jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public
                        injunctive relief
                        shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration. Before a
                        court of
                        competent jurisdiction issues any public injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of
                        the arbitration
                        award on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the arbitrator.
    
                        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the KAA Rules. You are
                        required to pay
                        KAA’s initial filing fee, but Snip will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the
                        arbitration to
                        the extent it exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a court in your county of residence. If the
                        arbitrator finds
                        that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
                        frivolous or was
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Rule of Civil Procedure
                        11(b)), then the
                        payment of all fees will be governed by the KAA Rules and Snip will not reimburse your initial
                        filing fee. You and
                        Snip agree that the kAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or
                        arbitration fees due
                        under the KAA Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase
                        the KAA fees to
                        you or Snip and you and Snip waive any objection to such fee modification.
    
                        You and Snip agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual
                        capacity, and not as
                        a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, if you
                        have elected
                        arbitration, unless both you and Snip agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate any other
                        person's Claims
                        with your Claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                        proceeding. If Snip
                        believes that any Claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with the
                        limitations in this
                        paragraph, then you agree that Snip may seek an order from a court determining whether your Claim is
                        within the
                        scope of the Class Action Waiver. If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the
                        entirety of
                        this Dispute Resolution Section shall be null and void.

                    <p>If it turns out that a section of these Terms isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or
                        edited as little as required, and the rest of the Agreement will still be valid.</p><br>
    
                    <li class="bold italics">Interpretation</li>
                    <p>The headers and sidebar text are provided only to make these Terms easier to read and understand. The
                        fact that we wrote these Terms won’t affect the way the Agreement is interpreted.</p><br>
    
                    <li class="bold italics">Waiver</li>
                    <p>If we don’t immediately take action on a violation of these Terms, we’re not giving up any rights
                        under the Terms, and we may still take action at some point.</p><br>
    
                    <li class="bold italics">Further Actions</li>
                    <p>You’ll provide all documents and take any actions necessary to meet your obligations under these
                        Terms.</p><br>
    
                    <li class="bold italics">Notification of Security Incident</li>
                    <p>If we become aware of a security incident related to our systems or databases that contain personal
                        information of you or your contacts, we’ll notify you if required by law. In that event, we’ll also
                        provide you with information about that incident so that you can evaluate the consequences to you
                        and any legal or regulatory requirements that may apply to you, unless we’re prevented from doing so
                        by legal, security or confidentiality obligations. Notifying you of a security incident or
                        cooperating with you to respond to one will not be deemed an acknowledgement or assumption of any
                        liability or fault of Snip for such incident.</p><br>
    
                    <li class="bold italics">Entire Agreement</li>
                    <p>The Agreement, including these Terms and any Additional Terms you’ve agreed to by enabling any
                        Add-ons, make up the entire agreement between us in relation to its subject matter and supersede all
                        prior agreements, representations, and understandings. Any Additional Terms will be considered
                        incorporated into the Agreement when you activate or use the corresponding Add-on or feature of the
                        Service.
                        Where there’s a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will
                        control to the extent of the conflict.</p><br>
